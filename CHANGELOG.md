# Changelog

All notable changes to VidShrink Player are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The history of the program under its old name, VidShrink, up to 1.2.24 and the changes
made after it, is in [`docs/CHANGELOG-VidShrink.md`](docs/CHANGELOG-VidShrink.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Recorder: a reassignable hotkey (Ctrl+F3 by default) cycles the drawing ink while the drawing layer is open.

### Fixed

- Recorder: on several monitors the drawing layer opens on the right screen. Without a capture area it covers the
  screen under the pointer instead of always the primary one; an area spanning monitors with different scaling is
  trimmed to one monitor so the layer is not sized with the wrong scale.

## [0.0.1]

### Changed

- VidShrink is now VidShrink Player. The program window and the documents use the new
  name.
- The repository is now [Teknesyum/VidShrink-Player](https://github.com/Teknesyum/VidShrink-Player).
- Version numbers start again at `0.0.1`. The last release under the old name was 1.2.24;
  everything listed under its Unreleased section in the old changelog ships in this release.

### Moving From VidShrink

- One manual step, once. If your VidShrink install does not offer VidShrink Player as an
  update, install it once with any of the ways in the [README](README.md#install). Updates
  after that arrive as before.
