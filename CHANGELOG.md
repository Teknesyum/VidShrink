# Changelog

All notable changes to VidShrink Player are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The history of the program under its old name, VidShrink, up to 1.2.24 and the changes
made after it, is in [`docs/CHANGELOG-VidShrink.md`](docs/CHANGELOG-VidShrink.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Recorder: per-app audio. The audio list offers each program that is playing sound and records only that program
  (Windows 10 2004 and later; on older systems and outside Windows the entry is shown disabled with the reason).
- Recorder: "Frame" button on the result panel. Puts the finished recording on a solid color, one of four
  gradients from the palette or an image of your own, with padding, rounded corners and a shadow.

## [0.0.1]

### Changed

- VidShrink is now VidShrink Player. The program window and the documents use the new
  name.
- The repository is now [Teknesyum/VidShrink-Player](https://github.com/Teknesyum/VidShrink-Player).
- Version numbers start again at `0.0.1`. The last release under the old name was 1.2.24;
  everything listed under its Unreleased section in the old changelog ships in this release.

### Moving From VidShrink

- One manual step, once. If your VidShrink install does not offer VidShrink Player as an
  update, install it once with any of the ways in the [README](README.md#install). Updates
  after that arrive as before.
